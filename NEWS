Version 0.8.1 - March 22, 2011

- Make --user, --pass actually work

- Add User-Agent HTTP header to requests, so that server operators may
  more easily identify the miner client.

- Fix minor bug in example JSON config file

Version 0.8 - March 21, 2011

- Support long polling: http://deepbit.net/longpolling.php

- Adjust max workload based on scantime (default 5 seconds,
  or 60 seconds for longpoll)

- Standardize program output, and support syslog on Unix platforms

- Suport --user/--pass options (and "user" and "pass" in config file),
  as an alternative to the current --userpass

Version 0.7.2 - March 14, 2011

- Add port of ufasoft's sse2 assembly implementation (Linux only)
  This is a substantial speed improvement on Intel CPUs.

- Move all JSON-RPC I/O to separate thread.  This reduces the
  number of HTTP connections from one-per-thread to one, reducing resource
  usage on upstream bitcoind / pool server.

Version 0.7.1 - March 2, 2011

- Add support for JSON-format configuration file.  See example
  file example-cfg.json.  Any long argument on the command line
  may be stored in the config file.
- Timestamp each solution found
- Improve sha256_4way performance.  NOTE: This optimization makes
  the 'hash' debug-print output for sha256_way incorrect.
- Use __builtin_expect() intrinsic as compiler micro-optimization
- Build on Intel compiler
- HTTP library now follows HTTP redirects

Version 0.7 - February 12, 2011

- Re-use CURL object, thereby reuseing DNS cache and HTTP connections
- Use bswap_32, if compiler intrinsic is not available
- Disable full target validation (as opposed to simply H==0) for now

Version 0.6.1 - February 4, 2011

- Fully validate "hash < target", rather than simply stopping our scan
  if the high 32 bits are 00000000.
- Add --retry-pause, to set length of pause time between failure retries
- Display proof-of-work hash and target, if -D (debug mode) enabled
- Fix max-nonce auto-adjustment to actually work.  This means if your
  scan takes longer than 5 seconds (--scantime), the miner will slowly
  reduce the number of hashes you work on, before fetching a new work unit.

Version 0.6 - January 29, 2011

- Fetch new work unit, if scanhash takes longer than 5 seconds (--scantime)
- BeeCee1's sha256 4way optimizations
- lfm's byte swap optimization (improves via, cryptopp)
- Fix non-working short options -q, -r

Version 0.5 - December 28, 2010

- Exit program, when all threads have exited
- Improve JSON-RPC failure diagnostics and resilience
- Add --quiet option, to disable hashmeter output.

Version 0.3.3 - December 27, 2010

- Critical fix for sha256_cryptopp 'cryptopp_asm' algo

Version 0.3.2 - December 23, 2010

- Critical fix for sha256_via

Version 0.3.1 - December 19, 2010

- Critical fix for sha256_via
- Retry JSON-RPC failures (see --retry, under "minerd --help" output)

Version 0.3 - December 18, 2010

- Add crypto++ 32bit assembly implementation
- show version upon 'minerd --help'
- work around gcc 4.5.x bug that killed 4way performance

Version 0.2.2 - December 6, 2010

- VIA padlock implementation works now
- Minor build and runtime fixes

Version 0.2.1 - November 29, 2010

- avoid buffer overflow when submitting solutions
- add Crypto++ sha256 implementation (C only, ASM elided for now)
- minor internal optimizations and cleanups

Version 0.2 - November 27, 2010

- Add script for building a Windows installer
- improve hash performance (hashmeter) statistics
- add tcatm 4way sha256 implementation
- Add experimental VIA Padlock sha256 implementation

Version 0.1.2 - November 26, 2010

- many small cleanups and micro-optimizations
- build win32 exe using mingw
- RPC URL, username/password become command line arguments
- remove unused OpenSSL dependency

Version 0.1.1 - November 24, 2010

- Do not build sha256_generic module separately from cpuminer.

Version 0.1 - November 24, 2010

- Initial release.
